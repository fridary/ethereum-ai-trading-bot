# Ethereum Meme Coins AI Trading Bot

This project is an AI-powered, real-time trading framework for meme coins and altcoins on Ethereum decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap, focusing on the rapidly evolving DeFi ecosystem. Meme coins have evolved from simple joke cryptocurrencies into a significant segment of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Meme coin and altcoin market has exploded with thousands of tokens, often built on the Ethereum blockchain. These tokens typically gain value through community engagement, viral marketing, and speculative trading rather than fundamental utility.

I wrote this system for myself from scratch, so it will not be possible to launch it quickly, since it is in its raw form. I was actively working on this in 2024, and now I have abandoned it, so I think I should post my source codes, because there are many useful utilities and functions for connecting to nodes and working with them, which will save you a lot of programming time, especially indexing the blockchain in a convenient structured form.

The decentralized exchange (DEX) environment has made launching new tokens incredibly accessible, creating opportunities for both legitimate projects and scams. Traders in this space face significant challenges:

- Extreme volatility with price movements of 1000%+ in minutes
- High frequency of new token launches (hundreds daily)
- Complex contract interactions requiring technical knowledge
- Prevalence of scams and rug pulls
- Need for rapid decision-making based on technical and social signals

This fast-paced, high-risk environment has created demand for sophisticated trading tools that leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify opportunities and minimize risks.

## Project Overview

In recent months, meme coins have become a viral trend in the crypto world, generating high volatility and massive interest from both retail and algorithmic traders. Tokens like $PEPE, $DOGE, and $TURBO attract speculative capital and present unique opportunities for algorithmic arbitrage and pattern recognition.

This repository leverages machine learning, predictive analytics, and block-level real-time data from Ethereum nodes to identify profitable trading setups ‚Äî in particular within the first few minutes of a token's launch or major on-chain activity. Here is AI-powered trading system for Ethereum-based meme coins and altcoins. The system continuously monitors the Ethereum blockchain for new token launches and trading opportunities, using machine learning models to predict potential profitable tokens while filtering out scams.

The framework combines several components:
- üß† AI-powered machine learning prediction models (CatBoost-based classifiers)
- üì¶ Real-time block processing from Ethereum node (geth/erigon)
- üìà Liquidity and price anomaly detection
- ‚ö° Fast response to token events (Mints, Transfers, Sniper Wallets)
- üß¨ On-chain data indexing into PostgreSQL
- üîç Sniper wallet analysis, ROI, and behavioral statistics
- üõ†Ô∏è Modular architecture for strategy plug-ins

## System Architecture

### eth_newHeads.py

This is the entry point of the system that establishes a websocket connection to an Ethereum node to receive new block headers in real-time.

Main functionality:
1. Establishes websocket connection to Ethereum node
2. Subscribes to newHeads events (new blocks)
3. Processes each new block by passing it to sync_blocks.py
4. Ensures continuous operation with error handling

Key components:

- **WebSocket Connection**: Establishes a persistent connection to a local Ethereum node using the websockets library.
- **Event Subscription**: Subscribes to the "newHeads" event to receive notifications whenever a new block is added to the blockchain.
- **Thread Management**: Creates separate threads for processing each new block to prevent blocking the main event loop.
- **Error Handling**: Implements robust error recovery to maintain continuous operation.
- **Connection Pooling**: Utilizes a custom non-daemonic process pool to manage multiple concurrent operations.
- **System Integration**: Uses systemd journaling for system-level logging.

The script initializes the environment by:
1. Clearing any stale process states in the database
2. Cleaning log files for fresh start
3. Setting up the processing pool
4. Establishing the websocket connection
5. Starting the continuous processing loop

When a new block header is received, it creates a separate thread to process the block without blocking the main event loop, allowing the system to handle high throughput during periods of network congestion.

### sync_blocks.py

This is the core blockchain indexing system that:

1. Processes new blocks by extracting all transactions
2. Identifies token transfers, contract deployments, and liquidity events
3. Stores structured data in PostgreSQL
4. Identifies potential trading opportunities
5. Implements trading strategies
6. Executes trades when conditions are met

The module contains sophisticated logic for:

- **Transaction Parsing**: Decoding transaction data and event logs
- **Token Analysis**: Extracting token metadata, liquidity information, and trading patterns
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Generating features for prediction models
- **Trading Execution**: Implementing buying and selling logic

## Database Schema

The system uses a PostgreSQL database with the following main tables:

- `_blocks`: Stores block headers and metadata
- `_transactions`: Contains all transactions with detailed parameters
- `_logs`: Stores event logs emitted during transactions
- `_transfers`: Records all token transfers with value and metadata
- `watch`: Tracks tokens of interest for trading
- `trades`: Records executed trades and their performance

For the full schema, see `db.sql`.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Processes new blocks within seconds of confirmation
- **AI-Powered Predictions**: Uses machine learning models to predict potential profitable tokens
- **Scam Detection**: Implements multiple heuristics to avoid common scam patterns
- **Multi-strategy Support**: Pluggable trading strategy framework
- **Automated Trading**: Executes trades directly through smart contracts
- **Performance Tracking**: Records and analyzes all trades for continuous improvement

## Trading Strategies

The system supports multiple trading strategies:

1. **Bollinger Bands**: Uses technical indicators for entry and exit points
2. **Machine Learning**: Leverages ML models trained on historical data

These are test strategies to show how lib works. Template's structure I took from [FreqTrade](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade) crypto lib and used it for backtesting (you should modify it to use on DEX instead of CEX).
